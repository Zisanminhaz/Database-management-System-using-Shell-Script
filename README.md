# Database-management-System-using-Shell-Script
In our "Operating System" course at DIU, my teammate Md Shahriar Mannan Prottoy and I embarked on an exciting project to simulate the core functionalities of a MySQL database using Bash scripting. Drawing upon the fundamental concepts we learned, including command-line operations, pipelines, variables, control flow structures (for, while, if, and case statements), functions, and automation techniques, we successfully developed a script capable of handling several essential database management tasks.

Our project provides a command-line interface that allows users to interact with a simulated database environment. The script enables users to perform crucial operations such as creating new databases, effectively organizing and isolating data. Furthermore, it offers the ability to list all existing databases, providing a clear overview of the available data storage units. For database maintenance, the script also incorporates a function to delete existing databases, allowing for the removal of obsolete or unnecessary data containers.

Beyond database creation and management, our Bash script extends its capabilities to the manipulation of data within these simulated databases. Users can create new tables within a selected database, defining the structure for storing specific information. The script also facilitates the insertion of data into these tables, allowing for the population of the database with relevant records. Moreover, it supports updating existing data within the tables, enabling modifications and corrections as needed. Finally, the script provides a crucial function for selecting and displaying the contents of a table, allowing users to retrieve and examine the stored information.

This project served as a valuable practical application of the theoretical knowledge gained in our "Operating System" course. By simulating the fundamental operations of a database system using Bash scripting, we gained a deeper understanding of how these underlying mechanisms work. The process involved careful planning, logical structuring of the code using control statements and functions, and effective utilization of command-line tools and pipelines to achieve the desired database functionalities. This endeavor not only reinforced our understanding of Bash scripting but also provided insights into the basic principles of database management.
